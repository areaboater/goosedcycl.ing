## Joy Memorial 2024
Get ready to rock [New Hope](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XzR9FELZhfphwkq87), June 9th, 2024! 
Weekend racing is back in a big way this summer for Minnesota. The Joy Memorial Crit is 1 
of 7 races in the Northern Lights Grand Prix series, check out [MCF.net](https://mcf.net) 
for more. 

If you aren't familiar with criterium racing, it's a time-boxed bike race with many laps on 
a short course (in this case, 1.1 miles). Racers in a field all go together, in one pack (opposed to
a time trial, where riders compete relatively isolated).
At some point the "time left" turns to "laps left", and the first one across the line when there are no 
laps left is crowned the winner :crown:. It's not just a thrilling way to race, it's a great format for
spectators and fans, because you have bikes whizzing by every ~2.5 minutes.

This is a family friendly event, all are welcome. We have fields for beginners, experienced fast folks,
kids, and everyone in between. Don't have a race license? No worries! You can buy a 1-day license. 

[Registration open now](https://www.bikereg.com/joy-memorial-criterium-2024)! :tada:
